# Archived Design Documents

**Status:** Reference Only
**Date:** 2025-12-02

## Purpose

These documents contain detailed specifications created during the design phase. The key information has been consolidated into the main **SYSTEM_DESIGN.md** at the project root.

**These are kept for:**
- Reference and audit purposes
- Deep technical details
- Historical record of design process

**You don't need to read these** unless you want extremely detailed specifications.

## What to Read Instead

**For 99% of use cases, read these instead:**

1. **README.md** (root) - 5-min project overview
2. **SYSTEM_DESIGN.md** (root) - Complete technical design (15-min read)
3. **TODO.md** (root) - Implementation checklist
4. **.claude.md** (root) - AI context for new sessions
